## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Vue.js 3**: Progressive JavaScript framework
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Vue Router**: Client-side routing
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Markup and styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Programming language

### Planned Backend (not yet implemented)
- Python with FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- SQLite database

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

1. **Vue Components**
   - Use Vue 3 Composition API where appropriate
   - Keep components focused and single-purpose
   - Use meaningful component and variable names
   - Follow Vue.js style guide conventions

2. **JavaScript**
   - Use ES6+ features (arrow functions, async/await, destructuring)
   - Use camelCase for variables and functions
   - Use PascalCase for component names
   - Add comments for complex logic

3. **CSS**
   - Use existing CSS variables defined in `main.css`
   - Follow mobile-first responsive design
   - Maintain consistency with existing styling patterns
   - Support dark theme using `.dark-theme` class

4. **File Organization**
   - Place new Vue views in `frontend/src/views/`
   - Place reusable components in `frontend/src/components/`
   - Place static assets in `frontend/src/assets/`

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Branching Strategy**
   - `main` branch: Stable production code
   - `frontend` branch: Frontend development
   - `backend-py` branch: Backend development (when implemented)
   - Feature branches: `feature/description` or `fix/description`

2. **Pull Request Targets**
   - Frontend contributions → `frontend` branch
   - Backend contributions → `backend-py` branch
   - Documentation/other → `main` branch

3. **Before Making Changes**
   - Review CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed contribution steps
   - Open an issue to discuss significant changes
   - Fork the repository and create a feature branch
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

### Testing and Building

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Important Considerations

1. **Privacy and Security**
   - This platform handles sensitive user data about violence and mental health
   - Always prioritize user privacy and data security
   - Use secure authentication and authorization patterns
   - Never expose sensitive information in logs or error messages

2. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure the platform is accessible to users with disabilities
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Provide alt text for images
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works properly

3. **Inclusive Language**
   - Use respectful and inclusive language
   - Be sensitive to the trauma victims may have experienced
   - Follow the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md guidelines

4. **Mobile-First Design**
   - The platform should work well on mobile devices
   - Test responsive layouts at various screen sizes
   - Consider touch-friendly interface elements

## Common Tasks

3. Test both light and dark themes
4. Maintain consistency with existing pages

### Working with API Calls

1. Use Axios for HTTP requests
2. Handle loading states appropriately
